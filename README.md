**Intelligent tool accelerates discovery of high-performance hard metal coatings**

HORIZON-CL4-2022-RESILIENCE-01-19 - Advanced materials modelling and characterisation (RIA)

*Thermal spraying produces coatings based on metals, alloys, ceramics, plastics and composites by projecting melted or heated powders onto surfaces. Among the available coating materials, hard metals provide excellent resistance to wear and corrosion. However, current hard metal coatings are based on critical elements (Co, W). Moreover, their properties are typically optimised by costly trial-and-error approaches. Creating a reliable selection tool solely based on experimental data would be too cumbersome. Even using microstructure-based physical models to predict their properties would take a lot of time. The EU-funded CoBRAIN project aims to tackle these issues by integrating computational and experimental data with artificial intelligence through semantic interoperability. CoBRAIN will develop an intelligent tool to propose novel solutions from the class of critical materials-free high-entropy hard metals.*
